<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3>Landing Page Project</h3>
<p>This is an educational project submitted to Udacity through EgFWD </p>
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>Creating a landing page using various JavaScript functions</p>
<p> First of all I created global variables to hold the section and the navigation bar list</p>
<p>second I began my work by buildnav function that takes sections and navlist as parameter, I started a for each loop on sections with element as argument to loop on all the sections we have and for every section, an anchor tag is added to hold the menu__link class and linking each list item to the appropriate section using href element.id to get the actual section id and the text, and called build nav function to begin.</p>
<p>after that I add an event listener  to do multiple things</p> 
<p>1.decide when the scroll up button appear</p> 
<p>2.added another for each section to get the view rectangle and decide which section is in view port and adding your-active-class to this section</p> 
<p>3. when the section is no longer in view the your-active-class is removed.</p>
<p>4. added the smooth scrolling when navigation bar item is clicked</p>
