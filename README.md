# Introduction
### Landing Page Project
### This is an educational project submitted to Udacity through EgFWD
# Project Overview
#### Creating a landing page using various JavaScript functions</p>
First of all I created global variables to hold the section and the navigation bar list
second I began my work by buildnav function that takes sections and navlist as parameter, I started a for each loop on sections with element as argument to loop on all the sections we have and for every section, an anchor tag is added to hold the menu__link class and linking each list item to the appropriate section using href element.id to get the actual section id and the text, and called build nav function to begin.
after that I add an event listener  to do multiple things
1. decide when the scroll up button appear
2. added another for each section to get the view rectangle and decide which section is in view port and adding your-active-class to this section.
3. when the section is no longer in view the your-active-class is removed.
4. added the smooth scrolling when navigation bar item is clicked.
